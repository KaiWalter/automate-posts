## Learnings

- the temptation to forget about the PRD / requirements document and stringent process with the instructions --- just "prompt on"
- always consequently feedback coding assistants unmet expectations in the code generated not only in the correction of the implementation but likewise in the PRD / requirements document or the coding instructions

- large file - docker compose - with GPT4.1 , mislead dependencies --> split what to put in Dockerfile

- Python Dapr Subscription HTTP implementation --> replace by GrpC

This intent was successfully acted upon, and the to-do item has been created.\n\n2. **Additional Transcription**: The second transcription from the file `./.work/voice/test20250824T1503120000.json` contained no explicit planning intent and was treated as a note.\n\nWith the to-do item established and no further action required for the second transcription, the task is considered completed.
